Title: Calculate Sums and Differences of Positive Numbers Represented on the Log Scale
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David Clausen
Maintainer: David Clausen <dsc24@uw.edu>
Description: This package provides functions to compute, for positive numbers x and y, log(x + y) and log(x - y) from input log(x) and log(y without direct exponentiation.  This can be helpful in avoiding over- and underflow problems when x and y are either very  large or very small in absolute value.
